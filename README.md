# WonderLust - Travel Recommendation Program

## Overview
WonderLust is a practical, Python-based, travel inspiration tool that suggests travel destinations based on user preferences. By considering Vacation Type, Budget Constraints, and Travel Season, it filters through a curated list of cities to recommend the best match.

## How It Works
- The user selects two out of three criteria: Vacation Type, Budget, or Season.
- The program filters destinations accordingly.
- Results are refined using set operations and dictionary lookups to ensure tailored recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Personalised Matching**: Cities are selected based on user preferences.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Uses dictionaries for structured storage and retrieval.
- **Error Handling**: `try/except` blocks prevent unexpected crashes.
- **Set Operations**: Avoids duplicate recommendations.

## Running the Program
To run WonderLust, execute:
```sh
python3 dream_vacation_planner.py
```
Follow the prompts to enter your travel preferences and receive destination recommendations.
